## üöÄ About Loki

 *Loki exists not for the ransomware potential, it was developed with the knowledge that modern day movements such as [reporters without borders](https://rsf.org/en) are frequently challenged in the fact they're censored and screened constantly when wanting to release press from blacked out countries or regions, the rising potential for [government media blackouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_blackout) is ever present and Orwellian control is on the north-bound increase.  Organizations like AVAAZ, Extinction Rebellion and Anon-cells, even press writers, reporters and private-individuals are under scrutiny and observation.
 
 Whether they're being pried on or not.  Loki is a form of resistance against state, government and corpo control of our data.  How safe is 'cloud' storage when in reality it's simply someone else's computer?  Can you trust Google, Microsoft, Apple, your own Government - well why take that extra risk when you can Loki vault your files with encryption before uploading, use it to encrypt/decrypt your Linux home directory on login/logoff or your SoHo servers along with LUKS.  Taking control of your data, your freedoms, the ability to share documents, resources and files without peer-oversight with Loki - manipulation is key and security starts at home.  If you're in the EU, know your rights and freedoms [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu_en) begin to fight back, the law is there for us too if you know how to use it.
## ‚ú® Features
Before you ask questions, do consult the Wiki first as it goes into detail about what 'Fernet' is, setting up `-vault`, etc and not reading the documentation and diving into an encryption tool **can** risk your valuable data being encrypted permanently, so it's worth reading up on first!
